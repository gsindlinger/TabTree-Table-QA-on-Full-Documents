header_description = '''
Header rows serve as a structural component at the top of a dataset or table, defining the meaning and context of the columns below them. Therefore the probability of a row being header row decreases by increasing row index. It also might happen that a table has no header rows.
Header rows typically contain labels that describe the type of data in each column, acting as a guide for interpreting the table's contents.
In tables with hierarchical structures, header rows can span multiple levels, using features like colspans to group related columns visually.
This layered organization allows for the representation of complex relationships between columns, improving clarity and facilitating detailed analysis of multidimensional data.
'''

label_description = '''
Label columns act as a structural component in a table, typically positioned on the left side, and provide descriptive or categorical identifiers for each row. The probability of column beeing a label column therefore decrease by increasing column index. It also might happen that a table has no label columns.
Label columns define the context or grouping of the data within the rows, allowing for easier reference and understanding of the dataset. 
In hierarchical tables, label columns can represent multiple levels of categorization, employing features like rowspans to visually group related rows under shared labels.
This structure enables the organization of nested relationships within the data, enhancing readability and supporting more detailed analysis of grouped or hierarchical information.
